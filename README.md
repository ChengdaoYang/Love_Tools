*************
### How to operate it
Analysts can create Company objects with Lovely_Tools, based on company's name, if the company is listed on stock markets.
Then they can simply call its method and attributes.<br/>
Fistly, create an instance and enter your email address:
``` {.sourceCode .python}
>>> c = Company('apple')
please type your email address, to recieve notification of monitoring stocks...
```
#### Attributes
- keyword: get the name of the company
``` {.sourceCode .python}
>>> c.keyword
Apple
```
- ticker: get the ticker symbol of the stock 
(from Yahoo website)

``` {.sourceCode .python}
>>> c.ticker
AAPL
```
#### Methods
- **monitor**() <br/>
Send email to analysts at regular time. Don't forget to sleep it by calling it twice. <br/>
This a very very awesome method, try it!  :) <br/>
see _example.py_ for detail

Given rising iPhone revenue, surging services sales, and lots of room to grow in the wearable tech space, investors would be wise to consider Apple's stock right now --especially 
because the company's recent stock price dip means Apple shares are now trading at just 12 times forward earnings. Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock price has tanked about 20% over the
past three months, which has had the unfortunate effect of erasing nearly all of the company's 2018 share price gains. Each week, I'm ranking the biggest companies that trade on U. S.

### Further Developments
- _More Email Contents:_ The current tool can only send an email about one stock, in the future it should be able send emails on a group of stocks at the same time.
- _Solve Time Complexity:_ Since the news data are very large, we didn't save it. Everytime users call a different method, the functions have to read all the news from all the websites again. However, if we want to solve the problem of time complexity, the memory usage of the computer will be very large, but Python has no memory management, so the conflict will be very large, unfortunately, we still have difficulty solving it.
- _Improve UI_: Our UI could be more user friendly. In the future users will have better experience when using our tool. 
- _Add More Features:_ When the index exceeds threshold, the tool will only make predictions in regular daily mail. In the future, the tool should be able to send an email as soon as it detects that the prediction index exceeds the threshold.
