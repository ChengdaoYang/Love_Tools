Shares of both Amazon AMZN  and Microsoft MSFT  have been hurt by the recent market downturn that has seen the likes of Apple AAPL  , Netflix NFLX  , and other tech giants fall. With that said, both AMZN and MSFT are still up big over the last year and the companies are headed in the right direction. AMZN Overview Amazon's Q3 revenues climbed by 29% to reach $56.6 billion, which fell short of Wall Street estimates and helped show that its days of massive top-line growth might be over simply because of its size. Still, the tech powerhouse is projected to grab roughly 50% of the total U.S. e-commerce market in 2018, up from 44% last year  . Plus, Amazon's advertising business is set to expand as more and more product searches begin on its site.Jeff Bezos' firm is now the third-largest digital advertiser behind only Facebook FB  and Google GOOGL  . On top of that, Amazon has expanded into the pharmaceutical industry and its Prime Video platform looks poised to stand out against Netflix and soon enough Apple AAPL  and Disney DIS  as it pushes deeper into live sports. And let's not forget that Amazon is still a cloud-computing powerhouse.    MSFT Overview Speaking of cloud computing, Microsoft is the second-largest  cloud provider-behind only Amazon-having grabbed roughly 14% of the cloud market in the third quarter. This put MSFT in front of IBM IBM  , Google, and Alibaba BABA  . On top of that, the historic tech firm has continued to dive deeper into artificial intelligence and IoT.Meanwhile, the company has bolstered its business through some significant acquisitions, which includes its June purchase of open source software powerhouse GitHub. Microsoft also landed some major contracts for its cloud and AI business this year, including Walmart WMT  . And let's not forget that its personal computing business is massive and helped its most recent quarterly revenues jump 19% to $29.1 billion. Stock Price Movement As we mentioned at the top, both AMZN and MSFT have seen their stock prices fall recently. Amazon stock is down 16% over the last three months, while Microsoft dipped just around 2%. Yet, Amazon stock has blown away MSFT over the last decade, but that doesn't really tell us much since the e-commerce firm has been on one of the most impressive runs in Wall Street history.Investors should note that MSFT stock hovered at around $110 per share through late afternoon trading Friday, which marked a roughly 5% downturn from its 52-week and all-time high. Meanwhile, Amazon stock sat approximately 18% below its recent highs at around $1,686 a share.     Outlook Looking ahead, Amazon is expected to see its Q4 revenues climb roughly 18.5% to reach $71.61 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company's total fiscal 2018 revenues are projected to jump 30.8% to $232.69 billion. Plus, Amazon's full-year 2019 revenues are expected to climb over 20% above our current 2018 estimate.At the bottom end of the income statement, Amazon's adjusted fourth quarter revenues are projected to skyrocket 153.7% to $5.48 per share. Meanwhile, AMZN's fiscal 2018 earnings are expected to soar 328%. Microsoft's outlook is a bit less impressive, which is to be expected based on its age. MSFT's current quarter revenues are expected to jump 12.2% to $32.46 billion. The company's full-year revenues are projected to climb at a similar rate to reach $124.08 billion-with the following year expected to jump 10% above that.Furthermore, Microsoft's adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to climb by 13.5% to hit $1.09 per share, while its full-year EPS figure is expected to expand by over 14%.    Bottom Line Both Amazon and Microsoft have strong management teams and have expanded their offerings to better position themselves for the future. We should note that MSFT has earned more positive earnings estimate revisions recently. Plus, Microsoft has been a dividend payer for years and its valuation picture-trading at 23.7X forward earnings estimates compared to Amazon's 64.3X-looks much better than its peer.On the other hand, Amazon will likely pay a dividend once its outsized growth starts to slow. But Bezos and Amazon are poised to continue to expand into as many new industries as possible. Therefore, it seems like it is a toss-up between Amazon and Microsoft at the moment since both stocks offer investors different benefits. 3 Medical Stocks to Buy Now

Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) isn't usually all that great at sharing its   offerings with other platforms, typically preferring to keep as   much as it can within its own proprietary platforms -- that whole   "walled garden" thing and all. It's extremely rare for the Mac   maker to offer its services on other platforms, but that's   precisely what is being announced today.   Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) has just confirmed that Apple Music will come   to its incredibly popular line of Alexa-powered Echo devices   starting the week of Dec. 17.That's a huge win for both companies.  Apple Music, coming soon to an Amazon Echo near you. Image     source: Amazon.It's worth noting that Apple Music has long been available on   Android, so it's not unprecedented for the company to make its   music-streaming service available on other platforms. It's   unclear how many Android users subscribe to Apple Music, although   the app's listing notes it has been installed over 10   million times.Amazon's own music-streaming services have never been that   popular. While the e-commerce giant said earlier this year that   it had "   tens of millions    " of music subscribers, that likely includes anyone subscribed to   Amazon Prime, which has the more limited Prime Music that only   has 2 million songs.The more important figure -- that Amazon won't disclose --   would be how many subscribers Amazon has for Amazon Music   Unlimited, which is more comparable to Apple Music and   Spotify    (NYSE: SPOT) . Spotify is also available on Echo devices, along   with just about any other smart speaker you can think of. Amazon   had merely said in April that Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers   had doubled over the prior six months. The company has always   enjoyed using those types of   context-less comparisons    .While Apple Music is coming to Echos, it's just as interesting   what's   not    happening. Apple isn't bringing other music-streaming services to   its own HomePod smart speaker, which still only supports Apple   Music. If the company were to bring Spotify to the HomePod, that   would dramatically expand the addressable market to include   Spotify's massive user base and potentially boost sales of the   $350 high-fidelity device. Spotify now has 191 million monthly   active users (MAUs) and   87 million    premium subscribers. (   Not all premium subscribers are MAUs, though    .)The news is the latest collaboration between Apple and Amazon,   which have been increasingly working together over the past year.   After a yearslong impasse, Amazon Prime Video finally became   available on Apple's tvOS platform late last year, signaling   that the relationship between the two rivals was warming up.Just this month, Amazon finally started to sell Apple   products (notably excluding the iPhone and HomePod) directly   on its site, the largest e-commerce platform on the planet. That   adds a massive distribution channel for Apple, while ensuring   Amazon customers can get Apple products directly from the Mac   maker. Historically, that void has been filled by third-party   resellers, many of which Amazon will no longer allow to sell   Apple products effective January.With Apple and Amazon increasing their coopetition, consumers   win.

This year, it's looking like Tracey Ryniec, from Zacks , has run away with the Best Stocks contest with her pick of Etsy (NYSE: ETSY ). Other years, the winner came down to the wire - in 2016, Charles Sizemore's pick  Energy Transfer Equity LP  (NYSE: ETE )  came from far behind in the final quarter to take the win .And two years ago, we decided to add a new twist to the contest - we started asking you, our readers, for your opinion on what would dominate the following year. The most popular pick that hadn't already been claimed would be put up against the experts.How well has the readers' choice done? So far, pretty good. I feel like we have a really knowledgeable reader base, and that has been borne out by the results - this year the readers' Best Stocks pick, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), has been hanging around the top five all year. Meanwhile the Best ETFs pick,  PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF  (NASDAQ: QQQ ), is actually leading that contest right now, and has been for a while.Not too shabby.So what will you pick as the best stock this year? You could go with Amazon for a third straight year. The growth story is undeniable, even as the law of large numbers starts to catch up with it. How about an energetic newcomer, like iQiyi (NASDAQ: IQ ) or Yeti Holdings (NYSE: YETI )? Maybe you foresee a pot stocks revolution taking Canopy Growth Corp (NYSE: CGC ) or Tilray (NASDAQ: TLRY ) to the top.And what about on the ETFs side? Maybe play it safe with a bonds ETF - or live dangerously with junk bonds? Bet on growth in emerging markets, or a resurgence in tech? Maybe something a little weirder with a catchy ticker, like the Janus Obesity ETF (NASDAQ: SLIM ) or the Video Game Tech ETF (NYSEARCA: GAMR ).Please vote for your picks  at our survey, and the top vote-earners not already chosen for the contest will be featured alongside the expert picks in our 2019 contests. And rest assured, if the top pick is already claimed by one of the contestants, we'll let you know so you can follow that pick as well.We will be closing the voting on Dec. 9. Good luck and pick well!As of this writing, Jessica Loder did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post Can YOU Pick the Best Stock and Best ETF for 2019? appeared first on InvestorPlace .

But, even Best Buy stock hasn't been spared from the recent retail carnage.While the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSEARCA: XRT ) has dropped more than 10% over the past four months, Best Buy stock has slid right alongside it, falling more than 20% during that same stretch.To be sure, the drop in Best Buy is warranted. The U.S. economy is starting to cool off, and further rate hikes promise to keep growth below previous highs.Meanwhile, Best Buy's growth is doubly cooling thanks to tough laps, and margins are starting to show signs of maxing out, too. Overall, the narrative at Best Buy, while still good, isn't great anymore.When it was trading at $80 in September, Best Buy stock needed great to head higher. But, now that it's trading at just $65 in late November, Best Buy stock doesn't need great anymore. It simply needs good, and good is exactly what will happen over the next several quarters.Moreover, it looks like Best Buy had a pretty good start to the 2018 holiday season, and this good start is the exact sort of catalyst this stock needs to turn things around.Overall, Best Buy looks pretty tasty on this dip. The stock is slightly undervalued, the growth drivers remain healthy, and broader market sentiment is improving.That is a winning combination for a bounce-back rally in Best Buy stock over the next several weeks to months.The turnaround story at Best Buy is quite impressive. A few years back, everyone wrote this company off as dead as peers like Radio Shack and Circuit City were filing for bankruptcy. The consensus thesis was that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) was going to kill the entire consumer electronics space, and that Best Buy would eventually head for the exits.That never happened. Instead, Best Buy reinvented itself as a omni-channel retailer which provided necessary in-store product insights and competitive prices and convenience.These operational improvements helped reinvigorate traffic and sales trends. Those trends were additionally boosted by the mainstream emergence of IoT and AR/VR technologies, which introduced new products like smartwatches, streaming players, smart TVs, and next-gen gaming consoles, the sum of which increased overall consumer electronics demand.Consequently, whereas Best Buy was left for dead at the beginning of the decade, this company is now one of the strongest retailers out there as we approach the end of the decade.In fiscal 2018, comparable sales rose 5.6%. That strength has continued in fiscal 2019, with comps running around 4-7% year-to-date and expectased to finish the year at 4.5%. Meanwhile, amid this renewed top-line strength, margins are largely stable, and that has helped power healthy profit growth.Yet, investors increasingly are concerned that Best Buy's golden era is coming to a close. They cite slowing comparable sales growth and maxed out margins as evidence that growth may have peaked at Best Buy.This is a true and accurate assessment. Comparable sales growth in excess of 5% wasn't sustainable and comps will go lower as the laps get tougher. Meanwhile, margins really don't have much more room to run higher from here.But Best Buy will remain a healthy growth company with stable margins going forward due to still-increasing innovation and demand in the consumer electronics space. Healthy growth isn't priced in at 12X forward earnings, giving the stock upside potential with the right catalyst.The right catalyst for Best Buy stock could be strong holiday sales.Last year, as the Street grew increasingly bullish on Best Buy's holiday sales, the stock went from ~$60 at the end of November, to ~$70 by the end of the year. We could get a similar rally this year, considering the valuation on Best Buy stock is presently very similar to where it was at this time last year (roughly 16X trailing earnings and 0.4X trailing sales).This bull thesis, of course, rests on the assumption that Best Buy has another strong holiday season. Early signs indicate that this will be the case. Data from Placer.ai , an analytics company which tracks foot traffic across tens of millions of mobile devices, reports that Best Buy's Black Friday traffic increased 18% year-over-year, versus an average 14% gain across the entire retail sector.Also, web traffic analytics site Alexa shows that web traffic trends for Bestbuy.com are spiking in late November in the same manner they did last year. Moreover, it appears the top gifts on Black Friday were essentially all consumer electronics related . That's a bullish read for Best Buy.Overall, it looks like Best Buy had a really strong start to the holiday season. If this strength persists, the Street should become increasingly bullish on Best Buy's holiday sales as we get closer to the end of the year. Last year, this increasing optimism lifted Best Buy stock nearly 15% in December. We could get a similar rally this year.Best Buy is a top-notch retailer with a sizable moat, secular growth trends, and stable margins. Right now, those winning qualities are being overlooked by a market worried about a looming recession.Nonetheless, we could see market sentiment reverse course sharply in December as the Street becomes increasingly bullish about Best Buy's holiday sales. This sentiment reversal could spark a healthy end-of-year rally in Best Buy stock.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long BBY and AMZN. The post This Is Your Opportunity to Buy the Dip in Best Buy Stock appeared first on InvestorPlace .

Shares of Lululemon LULU  popped over 2% Friday morning just a few trading days ahead of the release of the yoga and athleisure giant's third-quarter financial results, which are due out Wednesday. Lululemon's Q3 outlook appears strong and its stock price currently sits well below its 52-week high. Overview Lululemon helped jump-start the current athleisure trend that the likes of Gap GPS  and others have followed. The company is coming off a strong second quarter that saw its revenues surge 25% and its adjusted quarterly earnings skyrocket 97%. Plus, the Vancouver, Canada-based firm's comparable store sales jumped 10% and direct-to-consumer revenue soared 48%.The yoga power has also performed well amid increased competition from industry giants Nike NKE  and Adidas ADDYY  , while the likes of Puma and Outdoor Voices have also made inroads. Meanwhile, Under Armour UAA  , which has seen its stock price surge over the last year, has found it more difficult to break into athleisure. Price Shares of Lululemon have skyrocketed over 97% in the last 12 months, which blows away its industry's roughly 16% climb and the S&P 500's 3.5% gain. In fact, Lululemon has crushed everyone from Macy's M  to Amazon AMZN  in the past 52 weeks.Lululemon stock jumped roughly 2% through late-morning trading Friday to reach $132.15 per share. This represented a 20% downturn from its 52-week and all-time high of $164.79 per share, which sets up what could prove to be a solid buying opportunity for investors high on LULU.The chart helps investors put LULU's growth over the last 10 year into perspective.    Outlook & Earnings Trends Looking ahead to Wednesday, Lululemon's Q3 revenues are projected surge 18.5% to reach $733.49 million, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. Meanwhile, the firm's full-year revenues are expected to climb 21.8% to reach $3.23 billion.At the bottom end of the income statement, LULU's adjusted quarterly earnings are expected to pop 23.2% to reach $0.69 per share. More impressively, Lululemon's full-year EPS figure is projected to touch $3.58 per share, which would mark over a 38% climb from fiscal 2017.Investors should also note that Lululemon has seen a good amount of upward earnings estimate revisions recently. This helps us see that at least some analysts are more positive about LULU's bottom-line growth than they were even after the company reported strong Q2 results.    Bottom Line Lululemon is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), based, in large part, on its recent positive earnings estimate revision activity. The company also sports an "A" grade for Growth in our Style Scores system.It is also worth noting that Lululemon's management plans to expand its men's category to $1 billion by 2020 as it tries to hit an overall revenue goal of $4 billion. Therefore, LULU stock seems like it might be worth buying based on both its Q3 and long-term outlook, especially at its current price point.Lululemon is scheduled to release its Q3 financial results   after the market closes  on Wednesday, December 5. 3 Medical Stocks to Buy Now

On today's episode of the Zacks Friday Finish Line, Associate Stock Strategist Ryan McQueeney and Editor Maddy Johnson discuss the Fed's dovish turn, historic Cyber Monday sales, earnings from Salesforce and Dick's Sporting Goods, and what to expect from the G20 summit.Make sure to subscribe and leave the show a rating on Apple Podcasts  !It has been another busy week in global markets, as U.S. stocks on Wednesday posted their best trading session in eight months following Fed chair Jerome Powell's latest speech. Powell said that interest rates were just below the central bank's target, which was interpreted as a dovish turn from the "long way off" sentiment he had shared just months ago.This news followed reports that the Turkey 5-an Amazon-coined term for the shopping holiday from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday-witnessed historic sales. Amazon AMZN  actually announced that Cyber Monday itself was the single busiest shopping day in the company's history, while retail trade organization and data firms confirmed that the shopping holidays broke records throughout the industry.A few solid earnings reports, including that of Salesforce CRM  kept this positive momentum going. The cloud software giant this week comfortably surpassed earnings estimates and raised its full-year guidance, breathing fresh life into popular tech growth stocks. Earnings were mixed for retailer Dick's Sporting Goods DKS  , however. Dick's managed to beat bottom-line estimates and raise its outlook, but total revenue and comps disappointed investors.Now, Wall Street's attention will turn to the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, where U.S. President Trump and Chinese leader Xi will meet to discuss trade tensions between the two nations. The stakes are high for the Trump-Xi meeting, as investors have clearly declared their desire for progress to be made on ending the trade war.Did these trade tensions cause the Fed to turn dovish? Can holiday sales continue to beat expectations? Will Trump and Xi find something to agree on? Maddy and Ryan explore all of these questions, and more, only on this week's episode of Friday Finish Line!If you feel that we missed something, or if you want us to cover a different story, shoot us an email at podcast@zacks.com.
